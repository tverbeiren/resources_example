This is a minimum reproducible example for [quarto-dev/quarto-cli#4377](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/4377).

First clone this repo.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:tverbeiren/resources_example.git && cd resources_example
```

## First time execution

The document `document.qmd` uses a template which contains a resources directory.
The first time around, everything works fine.

```{bash}
#| error: true
quarto render document.qmd
```

## Rerunning a second time

This time around, resources exists but cannot be overwritten. Hence, the render command fails.

```{bash}
#| error: true
quarto render document.qmd
```

We can indeed see that the resources directory doesn't have write permissions.

```{bash}
ls -l
```

```{bash}
ls -l resources
```

```{bash}
ls -l _extensions/resources_example/resources
```


## Third time's the charm

By making the resources directory writeable again, we can again rerender the document.

```{bash}
#| error: true
chmod +w -R resources
quarto render document.qmd
```

Is it possible that `quarto` also performs a `chmod +w` on template resources, but doesn't do this recursively?

```{bash cleanup}
#| echo: false
chmod +w -R resources
rm -r document.pdf resources
```
